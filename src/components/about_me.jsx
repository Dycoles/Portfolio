            <p>My name is Dylan Coles. I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Game Development 
                at the University of Arizona. I’m passionate about combining technical problem-solving 
                with creativity to build innovative solutions and engaging experiences. 
                My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, 
                algorithms, and software development, and my time spent doing Game Development has 
                fueled my creativity and problem solving skills.</p>
